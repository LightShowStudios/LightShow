BETA 1

**

BETA 1 Release is now available.

Version  number is **3.0.5881.33900**

>Please ensure which version you are running before submitting issues.

Milestones have been added to allow for categorization of when the issue is expected to be addressed.  Jeff and I will try to mark known issues or items that are still in development with a label.

Beta 1 is primarily to be evaluated for work flow.  We currently have limited exception handling, so please be advised that if you don't save you could lose work.  Do not try to sequence an entire song.  It's not that it can't be done, it would just be a waste of your time as you may not be able to use that sequence later as we progress through betas.

Hardware mapping will not be available until we are ready for output.  There is no service release with this build.  The server explorer will probably crash if you try to connect to your existing LSP 2.8 service.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i>How to start:

 1. From the File Menu, create a New Project
 2. Expand the Project tree and expand Displays
 3. Double Click on Display
 4. Open a Background image from the ribbon and then draw some objects.
 5. Only RGB objects are supported at this time.  You can create a static object, but it will behave as an RGB object.
 6. You can rename objects and assign multiple drawing objects to the same object if wanted.  i.e. draw multiple lines for the outline of the house and assign them to one object name.  The drawing objects will still remain independent and not be grouped as a single drawing object.
 7. Once you have created your objects go to the project tree and right click on Layers.
 8. Select Add a new layer.  Repeat as needed.
 9. Open Objects in the project tree and then right click on an object to add to a layer.
 10. Once you have finished with objects and layers, right click on Sequences and Add a new sequence.
 11. Double click on the added sequence to open it in a new tab.
 12. Change the duration or add an audio file using the sequence properties drop down in the ribbon.
 13. Now you can add effects directly or add a time mark group.

There is a default time mark group that can be made visible, but it is basically time marks at every 50ms interval.  If you don't have a time mark group visible, it uses this by default.

>**You cannot currently move time marks after they have been placed.  This is in development.**

You can insert a time mark to an active time mark group during playback using the "i" key on your keyboard or you can insert them at fixed intervals.  If you have multiple time mark groups, the last one selected in the list will show on top if you have multiple at the same time.

>You cannot currently move effects and there is no copy/paste or undo/redo for the grid at this time.  You can resize effects.  Resizing an effect past the visible window without it scrolling is a known issue.  Zoom out if you want to place and extra long effect.

We are sure there are a bunch of items we are leaving out, but just ask questions if unsure.  We can tell you pretty quick if it is a known issue (in development) or a bug.

We are okay with seeing enhancements, but right now we would rather focus the enhancement requests on the usability and not feature requests.  But if you want to add a feature request that is fine so we can keep track, but it will most likely be ignored until we finish developing our current feature list.

Happy testing!
