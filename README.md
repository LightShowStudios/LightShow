# LightShow

Welcome to the LightShow Issue Tracker.

This repository will be used to track issues that you find. There will be no code stored in this repository. It is in a separate repository, but when we commit our changes in that repository, we will link to the issues in this repository to close the issue. Hopefully this will make it easier to keep track of what we need to work on bug wise and also what you have already reported to us.

Thank you for your continued support.
