# LightShow

Welcome to the LightShow Repository for beta testers!

This repository will be used to track issues that you find during beta testing. There will be no code stored in this repository. It is in a separate repository that Jeff an I will use, but when we commit our changes in that repository, we can actually link to the issues in this repository to close the issue. Hopefully this will make it easier to keep track of what we need to work on bug wise and also what you have already reported to us.

After beta testing is complete, we will continue to use this as our issue tracker for the release. Our users will not have access to this list and it will require our testers (you) to enter issues, if needed, as users submit support tickets.

This repository will also be used to keep our testers apprised of features that are being worked on.

Our current schedule for this year is the following:

Beta1 2/8/2016

Beta2 3/21/2016

Beta3 4/25/2016

Beta4 5/30/2016

Beta5 7/5/2016

Beta6 8/8/2016

RC1 9/12/2016

3.0 10/24/2016

The first couple of betas will be thin on some features as we are still incorporating them. They can actually be thought more as Alpha builds. Please be patient as we both incorporate features and work on the issue list during the first few builds.

Please do not share anything from the builds, issues, or enhancements outside of this group.

Happy Testing!

Ryan
